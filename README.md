# Zero/11ty

**Zero/11ty** is an Eleventy V3 starter kit designed to help you kickstart your static site projects with zero bloat. It's a clean, minimal setup, giving you the flexibility to build the way you want.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:dydric/zero-11ty.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will spin up a local server at `localhost:8080` with hot-reloading enabled for rapid development.

4. Build the site for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command will generate a fully static, production-ready version of your site in the `_site` folder.

**Start from zero, build something great.**
Enj0y!
